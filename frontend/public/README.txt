This is the public assets folder for the frontend.

Anything placed here will be served as-is at the web root.

Suggestions:
- Put example files under `public/samples/` (create it if it doesn't exist).
- Then you can access them via `/samples/<filename>` in the browser.
- You can also drag and drop them into the app upload area.

Examples:
- public/samples/invoice.jpg  ->  http://<host>/samples/invoice.jpg
- public/samples/table.pdf    ->  http://<host>/samples/table.pdf

Note: The backend currently accepts PNG/JPEG/WEBP images and PDF files.
